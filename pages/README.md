# About the Study

Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, MESA, is an NHLBI-sponsored 6-center collaborative longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese-American men and women initially ages 45-84 at baseline in 2000-02. There have been four follow-up exams to date, in the years 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-07, and 2010-11. Between 2010-2012, 2020 participants also were enrolled in a Sleep Exam which included full overnight unattended polysomnography, 7-day actigraphy and sleep questionnaires. The objectives of the sleep study are to understand how variations in sleep and sleep disorders vary across gender and ethnic groups and relate to measures of subclinical atherosclerosis.
