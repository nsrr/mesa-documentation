# Dataset introduction

The [MESA datasets](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR have gone through various post-processing steps in order to prepare the data for more widespread sharing. The datasets were based upon the [data prepared by the MESA Coordinating Center](https://mesa-nhlbi.org/). Changes and updates to the source data and variable definitions have been coordinated in the [mesa-data-dictionary repository](https://github.com/sleepepi/mesa-data-dictionary).

The [documentation folder](:files_path:/documentation) contains more detailed descriptions of the data collection protocols and source datasets.

## Structure of the dataset

For the NSRR, we have chosen key datasets and variables from the core MESA datasets and collapsed them into new, NSRR-specific datasets. The following individual NESA Sleep datasets have been converted and processed into the NSRR-specific format:

1. [Actigraphy (`MESAe5_SleepActigraphy_20140617`)](:files_path:/documentation/dataset-descriptions/MESAe5_SleepActigraphy_20140617.pdf)
2. [Polysomnography (`MESAe5a113SleepPolysomn_20150630`)](:files_path:/documentation/dataset-descriptions/MESAe5a113SleepPolysomn_20150630.pdf)
3. [Sleep Questionnaire (`MESAe5a113SleepQuestionnaire_20140617`)](:files_path:/documentation/dataset-descriptions/MESAe5a113SleepQuestionnaire_20140617.pdf)

## Subject identifier

Datasets and raw data files are keyed on the identifier ([`mesaid`](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mesa/variables/mesaid)) used in [MESA BioLINCC data releases](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/mesa/).
