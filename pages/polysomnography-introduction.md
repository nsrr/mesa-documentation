# Polysomnography introduction

In-home polysomnography (PSG) was conducted using the Compumedics Somte System (Compumedics LTd., Abbostville, Australia. The sensors and recording montage consisted of cortical electroencephalograms (central C4-M1, occipital Oz-Cz, and frontal Fz-Czleads), bilateral electrooculograms, chin EMG, thoracic and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography (by auto-calibrating inductance bands); airflow (by nasal-oral thermocouple and pressure recording from a nasal cannula); ECG; leg movements, and finger pulse oximetry. In addition to connection of sensors and electrodes, trained staff members completed signal calibrations and checked impedance.  Nocturnal recordings were transmitted to the centralized reading center at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and data were scored by trained technicians using current guidelines.
