# Polysomnography introduction

In-home polysomnography (PSG) was conducted using the Compumedics Somte System (Compumedics Ltd., Abbotsford, Australia). The sensors and recording montage consisted of cortical electroencephalograms (central C4-M1, occipital Oz-Cz, and frontal Fz-Czleads), bilateral electrooculograms, chin EMG, thoracic and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography (by auto-calibrating inductance bands); airflow (by nasal-oral thermocouple and pressure recording from a nasal cannula); ECG; leg movements, and finger pulse oximetry. In addition to connection of sensors and electrodes, trained staff members completed signal calibrations and checked impedance.  Nocturnal recordings were transmitted to the centralized reading center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and data were scored by trained technicians using current guidelines.

## Signal and annotation files

[Raw polysomnography data](:files_path:/polysomnography) is available for 2,056 MESA Sleep participants. Each recording has a signal file (.EDF) and two versions of the event scoring and epoch staging annotations (.XML).

1. **[EDF](:files_path:/polysomnography/edfs)** - Signal files in the [European Data Format](http://www.edfplus.info/) exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. **[XML (Profusion)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-profusion)** - Annotation files exported from Compumedics Profusion. ([Learn more...](https://www.sleepdata.org/tools/edf-editor-and-translator/pages/2-11-compumedics-format.md))
3. **[XML (NSRR)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr)** - Annotation files processed in the [EDF Editor and Translator](https://www.sleepdata.org/tools/edf-editor-and-translator) tool.
